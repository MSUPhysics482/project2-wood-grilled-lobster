## HW 11; Score: 16/20

Seth, the code you are writing seems to demonstrate some sort of phase space (t vs tdot?). I think that I'm going to need a bit more description of the model in some detail to make sense of your model and what you intend to present here. I get the sense that you are modeling something that you have investigated previously, but that you might be assuming that I know what that is from your previous work. In principle, I should, but in practice it's hard to remember the details of 18 different projects. So, please take some time before you finish the project to detail the model in a way that others will be able to make sense of and to describe the methodology that you are using to approach the problem.
