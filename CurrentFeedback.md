Seth, I think I have a better idea of what you are doing in comparing the different models for energy dispersion now. Cool idea! Ok, I trust the modeling that you are doing here, but I will need some full disclosure on the models that you are using and why you are using them. So in your poster, you will need to discuss the conceptual aspects of the models you are using - maybe a nice figure comparing how the different models take into account different aspects of the radiated energy (e.g,  just EM vs EM+bumpyness). Not everyone is an astro student in our class, so you will also need to explain what astro folks care about regarding EM in neutron stars and how they model this particular phenomenon, so think about that as you are constructing your poster.
