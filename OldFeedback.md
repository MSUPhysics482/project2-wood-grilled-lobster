Seth, the code you are writing seems to demonstrate some sort of phase space (t vs tdot?). I think that I'm going to need a bit more description of the model in some detail to make sense of your model and what you intend to present here. I get the sense that you are modeling something that you have investigated previously, but that you might be assuming that I know what that is from your previous work. In principle, I should, but in practice it's hard to remember the details of 18 different projects. So, please take some time before you finish the project to detail the model in a way that others will be able to make sense of and to describe the methodology that you are using to approach the problem.

Seth, I'm glad to see that you have a good idea of what you plan to do from a nuts and bolts perspective. I'd like to see more detail on the specific models that you intend to bring into your work. I also think you have a couple of great resources in Ed and Sean. Your figure makes sense to me, but it's not really what I had in mind. I was thinking your "figure" would show the model (i.e., an explanation of the model that you are planning to use). In any event, you have a good plan. Also, I know you want to dig into this project a lot; I want to respect your time, so when you start digging into it a bit more and explaning what you are doing, I'll probably advise you to reign it in a bit.
